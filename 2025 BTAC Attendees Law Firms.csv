This firm did absolutely nothing but dump my case onto another law firm after almost 6 months of wasting my time and not doing anything towards getting me a settlement offer. Especially since my accident was caught on video surveillance and it was what the state trooper used to determine the other driver was 100% at fault. I not only lost my car, i lost my job, my place to live, everything. And they did not care. At 51, i became homeless and jobless all bc of an accident that was not my fault. These law firm has questionable ethics and i even question their integrity. They didnt not even bother to let me or my insurance company know that they had dumped my case onto another attorney.

We chose this firm only because Wilber Hernandez recommended them, but that turned out to be a huge mistake. From the beginning, they were completely disorganized ‚Äî calling him multiple times with the same intake questions and never providing any real updates. After months of this, he stopped answering their calls out of pure frustration. It felt like they weren‚Äôt even keeping track of his case.
 
 They also asked him to locate medical records from years ago, even though he had already signed paperwork authorizing them to retrieve those records themselves. My husband works full-time ‚Äî we hired an attorney to handle the case, not to place the burden back on us. It was incredibly unprofessional and exhausting.
 
 To make matters worse, they claimed the other party had a letter stating that my husband was not injured, which is simply not true. There was no such letter, and that kind of misinformation is unacceptable coming from a legal team.
 
 After seven months of no progress, they finally called just to say they were dropping the case. No explanation, no accountability ‚Äî just done. I had even left a positive review early on, trusting in the process, but now I deeply regret it.
 
 My husband has worked with attorneys before, and this was by far the most disorganized and disappointing experience. I would not recommend Blaszkow Legal to anyone looking for real support or competent representation.",2025-05-16T19:56:30.772Z,Kimberly Lara,,,,,,

I can't speak for the entire practice or everyone involved, but the person I spoke to for intake consultation was unwilling to listen and constantly interrupted me but then projected that I ""wasn't allowing him to speak"" when I calmly answered his questions. I wasn't the one interrupting him, it was the other way around. Every time that he had a question and I answered he then responded as if I was wrong for answering his question directly.
 
 He also indicated at several points that he had failed to understand what I had just explained to him. This prompted me to have to repeat myself more than once to clarify what he was getting incorrect (he repeated back his understanding that didn't align with what I described). He had indicated at one point that the audio quality/connection was bad, so maybe that was a reason why he couldn't follow what I was saying. Nevertheless, this combined with his interrupting me to ask questions and then becoming condescending and accusing me of interrupting him when I answered his questions (always allowing him to finish what he was saying before I started talking) makes me feel the behavior and interaction made working with them intractable. Not because of me, but because of his demeanor and attitude.
 
 Funnily enough I was trying to seek help for a racial discrimination case clearly outlined in written evidence in exchanges between myself and the HR department at my job. It was while discussing the racial discrimination aspect of the employment discrimination (which also included discriminatory action as retaliation for reporting about discrimination) on top of disability accommodations discrimination, that I ran into this odd behavior. At no point when describing the disability accommodations related problems did he exhibit this pattern: it only started after I tried talking about racial discrimination that happened at the company I had worked for.
 
 I don't think this company is a good place to go to if you're dealing with complex (multi-faceted) or racial cases. I am disappointed because it has a good reputation and I had high hopes. Again, I can't speak for everyone and am not trying to suggest that the entire practice/firm is bad, but the person I spoke to was unhelpful in these ways and left me with a bad impression.",2025-07-30T15:05:36.758Z,Violet Davis,"I will post my review after I speak with my attorney but right now.............

I only discovered the formula for compensation had not been clearly described to me after I sat down and did the math in the settlement contract and realized it did not work out to what the formula as I understood it should.

He has no phone because of no Source of income anymore And, as his big sister, it upsets me, knowing they have a settlement amount to offer, but still cannot Help with a small advance, check, which is not much (100-500$) Since he lost his home as well, and is currently staying with me. Hopefully a review would get his attorney to get on the ball and give answers . As for Yesenia She‚Äôs probably the worst person to handle anybody‚Äôs case . The least she could have done was returned the call to inform my brother his Attorney somehow it‚Äôs too busy to answer an email . At this point I‚Äôd say they are just as bad as Jim Adler and only want money .

 I understand that firms have criteria for the cases they take on but the way it was communicated made it clear that unless a case is worth a certain dollar amount, it‚Äôs simply not of interest to them.

 5.2025 - updated review to reflect current experience. I was asked to provide the previous review on New Years Eve 2024. I was excited to get a call thinking there was progress in my case, there wasn't. I wrote the review based off my experience at that time. Now that I am 6 months out from the first review and my case is still open, I find I was more optimistic about the services because of the exceptional care provided by Pemberton's support staff. Communication, empathy and action items have seemed to stop. I finally spoke to the attorney for the first time on my case in January/February, a year after I hired the firm. Once the demand package was sent, communications went quiet on their end. In attempts to stay connected with my case, I tried setting up regular calls and am consistently met with no news or ""I have a call into them"". I signed a retainer when I was coming home from the hospital, I was vulnerable and feared if I waited to hire a firm, evidence of my accident might be gone. I am disappointed that a year and a half later, there's still no movement and no sense of urgency. If I had to do it again, I'd ask more questions, set expectations and also have the retainer reviewed by another legal counsel. I am hoping for a positive turn and will update this review at the end of my experience.",2025-05-28T21:34:52.000Z,C Jendz,,,,,,

Call Sam! These slimmy crooks wasted my time and gave me a nurse case manager that had no clue how to deal with someone with a head injury. (MITTEN CARE) I was coherenced into signing documents with uniformed consent. This was due to the fact I had pre-existing and accident related brain injuries.
 I was a victim of a negligent driver without insurance unbeknownst to me at the time...BECAUSE I HAD A HEAD INJURY!! I called an attorney because I was afraid of the insurance company and the claim I needed to file. Knowing I was injured and this was a life long injury I wanted the best to represent me while dealing with the scary insurance company. I had a valid full coverage policy with Progressive but sadly, coming from an at fault physical state of car insurance, I was unaware you need to check the uninsured motorist box. (Disclaimer: please do not hold me liable to my opinion with my expression of the preception of the events. I am no way trying to slander these companies. I am using this platform to express just that an opinion which I believe is still legal. If not, i apologize for being uninformed.)
 Being Michigan is one of the idiot states to have no-fault insurance laws which allows only for get something for nothing uninsured scammers to collect from us law abiding citizens, I called this attorney for help. They helped me to understand that since the young at fault woman who struck me from behind while I was at a complete stop before the hours of 0700 did not have car insurance thus a recovery source for them I am a pee on.
 So months later, now with neck, back, and Brain injury, I am being investigated by my own insurance company now as to whether or not they should pay for my injuries sustained in my not at fault car accident. It has costed me thousands of dollars out of pocket to seek less than satisfactory medical care directed by ""mitten careless"" who ironically was one of the few providers who did get paid. However, Rubix brain training, Cousineau Chiropractic, Vision Specialist of Michigan offered me the best care possible and deserves üëè üòÑ. Insane how less invasive modalities offer the most relief...unlike your insurance company üëÄ keep your head down.. wish me luck fellow not at fault insured motorist Godspeed",2025-07-07T12:28:53.845Z,Linda HD

I‚Äôm just glad to be done with this but make sure if you use them YOU do your own homework and have your own way of collecting evidence and information because they won‚Äôt do it for you from my experience.",2025-07-29T14:16:05.666Z,Katrina Tarpley,,,,,,
